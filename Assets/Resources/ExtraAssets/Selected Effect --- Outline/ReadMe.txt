Version 2.0 upgrade.
=> Add post process based glow outline tech. This tech will be work fine with non-smooth edge gameobject.
=> The performance impact of post process based glow outline tech is heavy than normal expansion.
=> The new demo scene demonstrates all features, switch enum inspectors "ET_NormalExpansion" between "ET_PostProcess" to check these two different outline techs.
=> In "Demo.cs" I use "Water" as post process based glow object layer name, you can change it and use a more proper name.

=======================================================================================================================================================================
Version 2.1 upgrade.

=> Support 2D sprite outline.

=======================================================================================================================================================================
